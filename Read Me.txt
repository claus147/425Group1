The "coaMipsAssembler" folder contains the MIPS assembler we have written for the first deliverable.
The "unpipelined_RISC.vhd" contains all the components and test bench for deliverable 1.
We are including this because we spend a lot of time fixing our deliverable 1 in order to proceed to deliverable 2.
To properly simulate the vhdl code, it is required to set the rst_external signals to high first to initialize.
After 1 cycle the rst_external can be set back to low again and the processor will work.



New components for this deliverable:
--- Early_branch_resolution.vhd
--- Forwarding_logic.vhd
--- Hazard_control.vhd
